React is Composable - David statue example with marble vs legobricks.

React is declarative - What should be done vs imperative - How should it be done (everything has to be clear and described well). Example below
Imperative:
const h1 = document.createElement("h1")
h1.textContent = "This is imperative"
h1.className = "header"
document.getElementById("root").append(h1)

Declartive:
Write JS like HTML with ReactDOM etc

JSX = JavaScript XML - think of it as a flavour of JS like HTML. Creates JS object and describes DOM. Includes props - header, and children. Remember\*\*

From 40:19 Goodbye, CDNs!, need to figure out how to get it to work importing react and not using links in head!
